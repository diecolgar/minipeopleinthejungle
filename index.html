        Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
        Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
        Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
        With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
        Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
        Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
        Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
        That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
        <span class="enlightedword">In the Beginning</span> how the Heav'ns and Earth
        Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill
        Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flow'd
        Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
        Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
        That with no middle flight intends to soar
        Above th' Aonian Mount, while it pursues
        Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
        And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer
        Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
        Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
        Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
        Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
        And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
        Illumin, what is low raise and support;
        That to the highth of this great Argument
        I may assert Eternal Providence,
        And justifie the wayes of God to men.
        Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view
        Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause
        Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State,
        Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off
        From thir Creator, and transgress his Will
        For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?
        Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt?
        Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile
        Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd
        The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride
        Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host
        Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring
        To set himself in Glory above his Peers,
        He trusted to have equal'd the most High,
        If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim
        Against the Throne and Monarchy of God
        Rais'd impious <span class="enlightedword">War in Heav'n</span> and Battel proud
        With vain attempt.   Him the Almighty Power
        Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie
        With hideous ruine and combustion down
        To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
        In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,
        Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.
        Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night
        To mortal men, he with his horrid crew
        Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe
        Confounded though immortal: But his doom
        Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought
        Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
        Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
        That witness'd huge affliction and dismay
        Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:
        At once as far as Angels kenn he views
        The dismal Situation waste and wilde,
        A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round
        As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames
        No light, but rather darkness visible
        Serv'd onely to discover sights of woe,
        Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
        And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
        That comes to all; but torture without end
        Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed
        With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:
        Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd
        For those rebellious, here thir prison ordained
        In utter darkness, and thir portion set
        As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n
        As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.
        O how unlike the place from whence they fell!
        There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd
        With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,
        He soon discerns, and weltring by his side
        One next himself in power, and next in crime,
        Long after known in Palestine, and nam'd
        Beelzebub.   To whom th' Arch-Enemy,
        And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words
        Breaking the horrid silence thus began.
        
        If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd
        From him, who in the happy Realms of Light
        Cloth'd with transcendent brightness didst out-shine
        Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,
        <span class="enlightedword">United thoughts</span> and counsels, equal hope
        And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,
        Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd
        In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest
        From what highth fall'n, so much the stronger prov'd
        He with his Thunder: and till then who knew
        The force of those dire Arms?   yet not for those,
        Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage
        Can else inflict, do I repent or change,
        Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind
        And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,
        That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,
        And to the fierce contention brought along
        Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd
        That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,
        His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd
        In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,
        And shook his throne.   What though the field be lost?
        All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,
        And study of revenge, immortal hate,
        And courage never to submit or yield:
        And what is else not to be overcome?
        That Glory never shall his wrath or might
        Extort from me.   To bow and sue for grace
        With suppliant knee, and deifie his power,
        Who from the terrour of this Arm so late
        Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,
        That were an ignominy and shame beneath
        This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods
        And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,
        Since through experience of this great event
        In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,
        We may with more successful hope resolve
        To wage by force or guile eternal Warr
        Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,
        Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy
        Sole reigning holds the <span class="enlightedword">Tyranny of Heav'n</span>.

        So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,
        Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:
        And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.

        O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,
        That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr
        Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds
        Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;
        And put to proof his high Supremacy,
        Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,
        Too well I see and rue the dire event,
        That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
        Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host
        In horrible destruction laid thus low,
        As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences
        Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains
        Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
        Though all our Glory extinct and happy state
        Here swallow'd up in endless misery.
        But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now
        Of force believe Almighty, since no less
        Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)
        Have left us this our spirit and strength intire
        Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
        That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
        Or do him mightier service as his thralls
        By right of Warr, what e're his business be
        Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,
        Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;
        What can it then avail though yet we feel
        Strength undiminisht, or eternal being
        To undergo eternal punishment?
        Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.

        Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable
        <span class="enlightedword">Doing or Suffering</span>: but of this be sure,
        To do ought good never will be our task,
        But ever to do ill our sole delight,
        As being the contrary to his high will
        Whom we resist.   If then his Providence
        Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,
        Our labour must be to pervert that end,
        And out of good still to find means of evil;
        Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps
        Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb
        His inmost counsels from thir destind aim.
        But see the angry Victor hath recall'd
        His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit
        Back to the Gates of Heav'n: the Sulphurous Hail
        Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid
        The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice
        Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,
        Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,
        Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now
        To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.
        Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,
        Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.
        Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,
        The seat of desolation, voyd of light,
        Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
        Casts pale and dreadful?   Thither let us tend
        From off the tossing of these fiery waves,
        There rest, if any rest can harbour there,
        And reassembling our afflicted Powers,
        Consult how we may henceforth most offend
        <span class="enlightedword">Our Enemy</span>, our own loss how repair,
        How overcome this dire Calamity,
        What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,
        If not what resolution from despare.

        Thus Satan to his neerest Mate
        With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes
        That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides
        Prone on the Flood, extended long and large
        Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge
        As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,
        Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove,
        Briareos or Typhon, whom the Den
        By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast
        Leviathan, which God of all his works
        Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:
        Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam
        The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,
        Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,
        With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind
        Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night
        Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:
        So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay
        Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence
        Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will
        And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
        Left him at large to his own dark designs,
        That with reiterated crimes he might
        Heap on himself damnation, while he sought
        Evil to others, and enrag'd might see
        How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth
        Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn
        On Man by him seduc't, but on himself
        Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.
        Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool
        His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames
        Drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld
        In billows, leave i'th'midst a horrid Vale.
        Then with expanded wings he stears his flight
        Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air
        That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land
        He lights, as if it were Land that ever burn'd
        With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;
        And such appear'd in hue, as when the force
        Of subterranean wind transports a Hill
        Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd side
        Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible
        And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,
        Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,
        And leave a singed bottom all involv'd
        With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole
        Of unblest feet.   Him followed his next Mate,
        Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian flood
        As Gods, and by thir own recover'd strength,
        Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.

        Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,
        Said then <span class="enlightedword"> The lost Arch-Angel</span>, this the seat
        That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom
        For that celestial light?   Be it so, since he
        Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid
        What shall be right: fardest from him his best
        Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream
        Above his equals.   Farewel happy Fields
        Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail
        Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell
        Receive thy new Possessor:   One who brings
        A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.
        The mind is its own place, and in it self
        Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.
        What matter where, if I be still the same,
        And what I should be, all but less then he
        Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least
        We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built
        Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
        Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce
        To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:
        Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.
        But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
        Th' associates and copartners of our loss
        Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,
        And call them not to share with us their part
        In this unhappy Mansion, or once more
        With rallied Arms to try what may be yet
        Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?

        So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub
        Thus answer'd.   Leader of those Armies bright,
        Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,
        If once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge
        Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft
        In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge
        Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults
        Thir surest signal, they will soon resume
        New courage and revive, though now they lye
        Groveling and prostrate on yon <span class="enlightedword">Lake of Fire</span>,
        As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,
        No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.

        He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend
        Was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield
        Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,
        Behind him cast; the broad circumference
        Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb
        Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views
        At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole,
        Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, Rivers or Mountains
        in her spotty Globe.
        His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine
        Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast
        Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,
        He walkt with to support uneasie steps
        Over the burning Marle, not like those steps
        On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime
        Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;
        Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach
        Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd
        His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't
        Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks
        In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades
        High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge
        Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm'd
        Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew
        Busirus and his Memphian Chivalry,
        While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd
        The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld
        From the safe shore thir floating Carkases
        And broken <span class="enlightedword">Chariot Wheels</span>, so thick bestrown
        Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,
        Under amazement of thir hideous change.
        He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep
        Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates
        Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,
        If such astonishment as this can sieze
        Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place
        After the toyl of Battel to repose
        Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find
        To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?
        Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
        To adore the Conquerour?   who now beholds
        Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood
        With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon
        His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern
        Th' advantage, and descending tread us down
        Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts
        Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.
        Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.

        They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung
        Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch
        On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,
        Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
        Nor did they not perceave the evil plight
        In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;
        Yet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd
        Innumerable.   As when the potent Rod
        Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day
        Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud
        Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,
        That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung
        <span class="enlightedword">Like Night</span>, and darken'd all the Land of Nile:
        So numberless were those bad Angels seen
        Hovering on wind under the Cope of Hell
        'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;
        Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear
        Of thir great Sultan waving to direct
        Thir course, in even ballance down they light
        On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;
        A multitude, like which the populous North
        Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass
        Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons
        Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread
        Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands.
        Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band
        The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood
        Thir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms
        Excelling human, Princely Dignities,
        And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;
        Though of thir Names in heav'nly Records now
        Be no memorial blotted out and ras'd
        By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.
        Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve
        Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,
        Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,
        By falsities and lyes the greatest part
        Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake
        God thir Creator, and th' invisible
        Glory of him that made them, to transform
        Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd
        With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,
        And Devils to adore for Deities:
        Then were they known to men by various Names,
        And various Idols through the Heathen World.
        Say, Muse, the Names then known, who first, who last,
        Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,
        At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth
        Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,
        While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?
        The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell
        Roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix
        Thir Seats long after next the Seat of God,
        Thir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd
        Among the Nations round, and durst abide
        Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron'd
        Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd
        Within his Sanctuary it self thir Shrines,
        Abominations; and with cursed things
        His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,
        And with thir darkness durst affront his light.
        First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood
        Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,
        Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud
        Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire
        To his grim Idol.   Him the Ammonite
        Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain,
        In Argob and in Basan, to the stream
        Of utmost Arnon.   Not content with such
        Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart
        Of Solomon he led by fraud to build
        His Temple right against the <span class="enlightedword">Temple of God</span>
        On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove
        The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence
        And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell.
        Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs Sons,
        From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild
        Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon
        And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond
        The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines,
        And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool.
        Peor his other Name, when he entic'd
        Israel in Sittim on thir march from Nile
        To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
        Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd
        Even to that Hill of scandal, but the Grove
        Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;
        Till good Josiah drove them hence to Hell.
        With these cam they, who from the bordring flood
        Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts
        Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names
        Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,
        These Feminine.   For Spirits when they please
        Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft
        And uncompounded is thir Essence pure,
        Nor ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,
        Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,
        Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose
        Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,
        Can execute thir aerie purposes,
        And works of love or enmity fulfill.
        For those the Race of Israel oft forsook
        Thir living strength, and unfrequented left
        His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down
        To <span class="enlightedword">Bestial Gods</span>; for which thir heads as low
        Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear
        Of despicable foes.   With these in troop
        Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd
        Astarte, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;
        To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon
        Sidonian Virgins paid thir Vows and Songs,
        In Sion also not unsung, where stood
        Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built
        By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,
        Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell
        To idols foul.   Thammuz came next behind,
        Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd
        The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate
        In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,
